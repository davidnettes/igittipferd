## tictactoe diary

Currently trying to get to work on a tictactoe game in python.

David joins the effort to get the git fun going.
We couldn't work out why he couldn't push changes to my repository. VS Code wasn't helping with their unclear commit process.

GitHub sharing and pull requests understood and trialed. The issue was that we were trying to have David access my repository by just pushing to it. We have now figured out that it takes pull requests to do that. He is sufficiently set up on VS Code to start work and collaboration on this project. Now I just need to catch up in terms of knowledge. I have no idea how to start. I don't even know what I need to know in order to get to work. First issue David proposed we solve was how to display the running status of the game, on screen, in the command line. Something like this is what we're currently thinking:
``` 
X|X|X O|O|O -|-|-
X|X|X O|O|O X|-|-
X|X|X O|O|O -|O|-
``` 
So the question to figure out is how we can have inputs map onto that graphical interface.
