This repository is used for collaborative projects by me, Len, and my friend David (@davidnettes).

I plan to write progress diaries for these projects. Hopefully David will add some entries as well. That would be cool. Maybe we can look back on these some day.

The first is to create and be able to play TicTacToe in python. We started work on this project on 18/22/2022. You can find it as `tttrepo`.
